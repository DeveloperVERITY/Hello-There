  <h3>This entry is devoted to introducing me</h3><br>
  <p>I am an aspiring game developer currently familiarizing myself with basic languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I hope to soon specialize in Unity, as I have a <i>relative</i> abundance of good ideas regarding the nature of future games. I am planning on purchasing <a href = "https://www.codecademy.com/subscriptions/proAnnualV4a_7trial/checkout?redirect_url=%2Flearn&checkoutv2=true">Codecademy Pro</a>, an interactive website with plenty of efficient, hands on courses. The languages that I will next study are C# and Java</p>
