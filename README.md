  <p>I am an aspiring game developer currently familiarizing myself with basic languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I hope to soon specialize in Unity, as I have a <i>relative</i> abundance of good ideas regarding the nature of future games. I am planning on purchasing <a href = "https://www.codecademy.com/subscriptions/proAnnualV4a_7trial/checkout?redirect_url=%2Flearn&checkoutv2=true">Codecademy Pro</a>, an interactive website that provides all of the resources necessary to efficiently learn how to program. The languages that I hope to transition to next are C# and Java; the main languages utilized in game developement, and, well, y'know. I am a 13 year old male from the Hawaiian island of Oahu, and yes, I'm done now.</p>
